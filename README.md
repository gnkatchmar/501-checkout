# Controlled Checkout

In this lab we'll focus on building 2 pieces of a checkout.

1) Will be the admin for setting up the store items
2) The second will be the user checkout portion
3) Enforce validation

## Admin

* Setup a way to create items that have a name, description, and price
* Ensure validation happens on the price
* Stores all information in the App

## User Checkout

* Show a store with "Add to cart" buttons next to the items
* Show a way to add items to add a single item to cart
* Add up all totals and item names
* Have a buy button that clears out the cart to nothing
